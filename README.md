# HTML-CSS-Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to take both HTML and CSS documents that were provided and refactor them into a more readable code that follows accessibilty standerds. The HtMl file uses semantic HTML elements in order to get a clear understanding of what each elements purpose is in the file and folows a logical structure indepents from the CSS file. while the CSS file is compacted in order to reduce the amout of code needed. 
    Throughout this process I was able to learn how many different types of elements there are and how they can be used to my advantage when writing out an HTML document. Along with that I was able to learn more effective ways of writing out a CSS file with out reapeting yourself.
